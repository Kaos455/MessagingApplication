# Messaging Application {Name not yet Thought of}

---

### Overview

The Idea for this project is to create a simple but scalable Messaging application that uses React (or Web components) for the Front-end and Node.js + Express for the Back-end. 

### Technologies Used

**Node.Js & Express:** Lightweight and fast server-side framework to handle messaging requests, API endpoints and facilitate communication between client and database.

**React (or Web Components):** React for building a dynamic user interface with reusable components, or Web Components for a vanilla JS approach to custom HTML elements.

### Goals

- User Authentication (e.g. OAuth)
- Real-time Messaging (e.g. Websockets)
- User-friendly UI for sending/receiving messages 
- Support for Group chats (Optional)
- Persistent Message Storage (e.g. MySQL)

### Project Structure

- **server/** : Server-side code using Express and any other Server-side technologies used
- **client/** : Client-side code using React (or vanilla JS) for the UI
  - **public/** : Will include any Static Assets such as images
